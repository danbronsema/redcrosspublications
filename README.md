Red Cross Publications (Wordpress)
==================================

Red Cross Publications (Wordpress)

- Based originally off Canvas (wooThemes), edited to align with Red Cross branding.
- Includes ability to add articles (wordpress posts) in monthly editions (wordpress categories).
- Loads articles using ajax requests in lightbox (fancybox2)
- Checks request, if its a fancybox2 request then serves up article content in lightbox, otherwise defers to a normal wordpress post page.

Working on line 28 on index.php
